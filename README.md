## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

**Note: These are just examples. Delete this note and replace the list above with your own choices**

### What I learned
I learned that I should not take svg elements from figma and put directly in my code. I need to recreate the svg element in my code using a button, and extra images given to me by the file. 

It's more professional to add functions to HTML elements in the Javascript file rathen than on the elements directly.


### Continued development

- I'm comfortable with non-semantic html. But in order for my website to be more professional I need to add semantic HTML into my projects. Therefore, I will be using more semantic HTML in my future applications.

- Get more comfortable switching back and forth from dev to normal mode in Figma.
